# Face-Liveness-Detection-Using-sequential-CNN
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive liveness detection and face recognition system using machine learning techniques. This task aims to evaluate your ability to design, implement, and assess models that can distinguish between real and spoofed faces and accurately identify individuals in real-world applications.
